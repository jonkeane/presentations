## A way to check that the code you wrote is doing what you expect it to.

---
# Easier said than done

<br /><br />
Any test is better than no tests

--
<br /><br />

but a good test is worth its (metaphorical) weight in gold

---
# A good test is ...
* quick to run
* expressive
* doesn't require special set up

--

# But databases are ...
* (relatively) slow
* rely on external state or set up
* requires a connection or custom setup

---
# CI + DBs = ‚ò†Ô∏è

Continuous integration (like GitHub Actions, Travis, AppVeyor) is wonderful, 
you can run your code on someone else's ‚òÅÔ∏è üíª 
<br/> <br/>

--

But then you're running your code in an environment you have to set up.
--
 That you can't interactively iterate on.
<br/> <br/>

--

Even installing R dependencies can be a pain.

# How does `dittodb` help?

---
# Imagine we had a function

```r
#' Get random airline(s)
#' ...
get_an_airline <- function(n = 1) {
  con <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), dbname = "nycflights")
  on.exit(DBI::dbDisconnect(con))

  query <- paste0(
    "SELECT carrier, name FROM airlines ",
    "ORDER BY random() LIMIT ", 
    n
  )
  
  out <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
  
  if (out$name == "Testy McAirline") {
    stop("This is the test airline üôÉ")
  }
  
  return(out)
}
```
---
# How can we test it?
Locally is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù we:
 * setup a local postgres server
 * make sure the correct users exist
 * add the test data
 * profit

--

On CI we ‚Äújust‚Äù do the same:  
 * setup a local postgres server
 * make sure the correct users exist
 * add the test data

# `dittodb` lets you ...

Write tests that act like they are connected to a real-live database using 
`with_mock_db({...})` without ever having to set one up.

<br/ >

```r
with_mock_db({
  test_that("We get one airline", {
    one_airline <- get_an_airline()
    expect_is(one_airline, "data.frame")
    expect_equal(nrow(one_airline), 1)
    expect_equal(one_airline$carrier, "9E")
    expect_equal(one_airline$name, "Endeavor Air Inc.")
  })
})
```

# Testing terminology aside

* mocks

* fixtures

* stubs

* spies

* fakes

* `r emoji("scream")`

???

* mocks -- objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification 
* fixtures -- data used by mocked objects to configure them or provide info 
* stubs -- provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.
* spies -- stubs, but keep and provide info about how and if they were called
* fakes -- objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory database is a good example)

Much of the above is from https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html

# Capturing DB interactions

Capture database interactions so that writing and editing the above is easier.

```r
capture_db_requests({
  one_airline <- get_an_airline()
})
```

<br />

Where `one_airline` is

```r
  carrier                 name
1      AS Alaska Airlines Inc.
```

---
# Capturing DB interactions

This response is saved to `testthat/tests/nycflights` in a file called `SELECT-c3427d.R`:

```r
structure(
  list(carrier = "AS", name = "Alaska Airlines Inc."), 
  class = "data.frame", 
  row.names = c(NA, -1L)
)
```

--

The path is `testthat/tests` and then the db name `nycflights` being connected to.

--

The filename starts with the SQL verb `SELECT`, followed by a hash that is unique to the query.

???

Because the hash is unique per-query that means this particular query will always return the same thing each time. But there are ways around this, for example by using a different mock paths.

---
# `dittodb` lets you ...
.flex-box[
So you can write your test like this

```r
with_mock_db({
  test_that("We get one airline", {
    one_airline <- get_an_airline()
    expect_is(one_airline, "data.frame")
    expect_equal(nrow(one_airline), 1)
    expect_equal(one_airline$carrier, "9E")
    expect_equal(one_airline$name, "Endeavor Air Inc.")
  })
})
```

.pull-right[... and it will run anywhere!]
]

---
# `dittodb` lets you ...

Write tests that include edge cases that ‚Äúshouldn't‚Äù ‚Äúhappen‚Äù in your databse.


```r
with_mock_path(path = "error_db_fixt/", {
  with_mock_db({
    test_that("We get one airline", {
      expect_error(
        get_an_airline(),
        "This is the test airline \U1F643
      )
    })
  })
})
```
